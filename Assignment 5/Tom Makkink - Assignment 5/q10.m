% 10) The purelin function in backpropdemo1b reaches the tolerance faster than the tansig function used 
% 	in backpropdemo1a. The tolerance (0.001) in backpropdemo1a is not reached in 100 iterations, 
%   while it is reached in backpropdemo1b in less than 14 iterations. 
% 	
% 	Overall, the networks with more layers had fewer iterations and hence converged faster
% 	than those with fewer layers.

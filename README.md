# Neural-Networks Course 

The code-base for the Applied Maths Neural Networks honours course at Rhodes University. 

The course consisted of 10 assignments, and 5 projects. 

The assignments explored regression, perceptrons, multi-layer feed-forward networks, radial basis functions, dynamic networks, and competitive learning. Each project involved applying neural networks to solving a specific classification/prediction problem, such as classifying breast cancer in mammograms, and is accompanied by a report giving further detail.
